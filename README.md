## CRITIQUE

> **Creator Feedback Platform (YouTube‑Focused)**

**Description**
CRITIQUE is a modern, creator‑first platform designed to help YouTube creators receive **real, actionable feedback** on their channels or individual videos. Instead of generic comments or vanity metrics, submissions are **problem‑driven**, guiding reviewers to give focused critique on areas like branding, engagement, retention, and growth strategy.

The platform emphasizes thoughtful discussion, unbiased first impressions, and feedback loops that encourage creators to actually apply suggestions and show progress.

**Key Features**

* 🎯 **Problem‑Driven Submissions:** Creators choose what they want to improve (branding, views, engagement, retention, etc.).
* 🧵 **Threaded Feedback:** Structured conversations instead of scattered comments.
* 🔍 **Blind First Impression Mode:** Unbiased feedback before channel identity or branding is revealed.
* 🔁 **Progress Updates:** Creators can post updates after applying feedback.
* 🔔 **Notification System:** Replies, mentions, and updates in a dedicated notifications page.
* 🌗 **Light & Dark Mode:** System‑aware theming.
* 🔐 **Multi‑Provider Authentication:** Email/password, Google, GitHub, and Facebook login.
